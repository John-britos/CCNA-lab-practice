## Objective

- Connect the network devices together according to the labels.
- Use the appropriate type of cable.
- For practice, assume that Auto MDI-X is disabled, or not supported on the devices.

NOTE: Packet Tracer doesn't differentiate between single-mode 
and multimode fiber, but think about which one is appropriate when you 
use a fiber connection.

## Steps Performed
-  Reviewed the topology to understand the cable requirements between devices.
-  Manually cabled the devices according to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet and fiber optic standards, considering device types and cable requirements.
