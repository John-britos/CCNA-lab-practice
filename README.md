# 📡 Cisco Networking Practice with Jeremy’s IT Lab (CCNA Labs)

This repository contains my hands-on practice and documentation as I learn **networking fundamentals** using **Cisco Packet Tracer** alongside the free **Jeremy’s IT Lab** CCNA course on YouTube.

I’m using this space to build up Networking skills through consistent practice, configuration, and lab documentation.

## 🧠 Topics I’m Practicing

- IPv4 Addressing & Subnetting
- MAC Address Tables & ARP
- Ethernet LAN Switching
- VLANs & Trunking
- Static Routing & Dynamic Routing (OSPF, RIP, EIGRP)
- ACLs (Standard & Extended)
- NAT & PAT
- DHCP, DNS, and Layer 7 protocols
- WAN Technologies & Encapsulation
- Basic Network Security Configurations

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** – for lab simulation  
- **Jeremy’s IT Lab** – [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeremysITLab) and lab files  
- **Cisco CLI** – hands-on configuration in labs
