# Cisco Networking Practice with Jeremy's IT Lab (CCNA Labs)

This repository documents my hands-on journey learning **networking fundamentals** using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and the **Jeremy’s IT Lab** CCNA video course.

I'm using this space to practice, take notes, and build lab activities as I work toward a solid foundation in networking and CCNA-level knowledge.
