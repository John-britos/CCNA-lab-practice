## Objective 
All devices have NO pre-configurations:

1. Configure the PCs and routers according to the network diagram (hostnames, IP addresses, etc.)
    Remember to configure the gateway on the PCs.
    (You don't have to configure the switches)

2. Configure static routes on the routers to enable PC1 to successfully ping PC2.

## Steps Performed 
1. Opened each routerâ€™s CLI to configure hostnames, IP addresses, and subnet masks.

2. Assigned IP addresses and default gateways to both end hosts.

3. Configured static routing on all routers to establish connectivity across the network.

4. Verified network connectivity using the `ping` command from PC1 to PC2.

### Reflection 
- Learned to manually configure Static Routing using **ip route ip-addr netmask next-hop** as well as checking the route table using **show ip route**.
- I'm getting much more comfortable on using the CLI now.
